Better Animals Plus seeks to bring new life and creatures to your worlds, all with a unique flair and aesthetic compared to other mods of the same category. The mod adds over 35 animals, and is constantly growing. We add not only animals but a variety of content, from blocks to armor, supplementing the creatures in the mod.
